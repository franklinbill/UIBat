# UIBat's Usefulness Evaluation Data
We provide the data of UIBat's usefulness evaluation, that is, the repaired app and the repaired code. The relevant information of the app is shown in the table below. I'm very sorry. Due to the upload **limit of GitHub file size**, there are errors in the relevant app APK and code. The applications we tested are all **from GitHub**, and the following table shows the details of the **issue ID** and **commit ID** of the application. Therefore, if the download is error, the relevant content can be retrieved directly according to the application name, issue ID or commit ID.


**No.** | **Commitid** | **APP Name** | **Category** | **Version** | **Download** | **Status**

UIBat can repair 121 unique UI display issues from GitHub. We submit 121 pull requests to the develop in GitHub, **92 of them are successfully merged** by developers, while the remaining are still pending (**none of them is rejected**). Actually, the user study also suggests the relatively high degree of satisfaction of our proposed fixing, i.e., **92 merged pull requests** and **66** of them receiving **“like”** in Github. 

When merging pull requests, the developers express thanks such as "*Thank you very much for this improvement, this is great. Much appreciated!*" (i.e., 4345457, PicardScanner), "*Very nice! Thank you for this contribution!*" (i.e., 8a76280, AlarmClock).
Furthermore, developers also express their thought about UI display issues "*I have to admit I didn't think of this kind of issue at first and after a bit of testing the problem seems to be a bit more complex beside these login screens.*" (i.e., 5fcf8e1, OpenWebWeaver).

For the idea of ''Search and Destroy'' of our UIBat, the developers of GPSlogger (a project with 1.4K stars and 1 million downloads on GitHub) give us an approving look with the message shown in below figure.
