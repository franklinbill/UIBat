# UIBat's Empirical Study Data
We apologize for the issue caused by the size limit in GitHub. We update the information on GitHub and move dataset to the appropriate platform, Zenodo. **Because the dataset is too large**, GitHub is limited by the file upload size. And there is a file error in the previously uploaded data. In order to facilitate the download of researchers, we uploaded the corresponding data sets to the anonymous **Google Drive**. The sharing ***link of Google Drive*** is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NT8RrcxBR8PGw2tdEGriCaqgsfHN5tEW?usp=sharing

We are very sorry. Due to the large size of the dataset, we tried to transfer multiple Online Disk(e.g., Onenote, Google Drive), and there were upload errors. In view of this situation, we have developed corresponding web pages in **UIBat website** for our dataset. Please note that we update our dataset in real-time on our **UIBat website**, and the web page is shown in the figure below. Click "learn more" of dataset on UIBat to obtain the information of this dataset page.
